3_players_dataset_creation.py
    Given
        - the Fantacalcio players list (manually downloaded from https://www.fantacalcio.it/quotazioni-fantacalcio in fantacalcio/Quotazioni_Fantacalcio.xlsx) 
        - the stats generated from 1_scraping_fbref.py script (fbref_data/outfield_players.csv and fbref_data/keepers_players.csv)
        - config/name_fix.txt (This is done for players for which the decoded fbref surname doesn't correspond to Fantacalcio list)

    Stage 1:
        - join outfield_players.csv and keepers_players.csv but only player(name and surname) and team columns
        - create two new colums surname and initial
        - split name and surname, take only the first letter of the name and normalize the surname
        - replace the surname for some specific players, according to config/name_fix.txt file (this is done for players for which the decoded fbref surname doesn't correspond to Fantacalcio list.)
    
    Stage 2:
        - read file at fantacalcio/Quotazioni_Fantacalcio.xlsx
        - normalize the columns name, the name and surname
        - associate players from Fantacalcio list to ID for FBref data.
